# Contact Form Project

## Description
This project is a simple web application consisting of three pages: a home page, a contact form page, and a thank-you page. The primary goal of this project was to create a fully functional contact form that sends user input to an email address using **EmailJS**. It incorporates the use of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a user-friendly interface and handle form submissions.

The form includes basic fields like name, email, and a message, and upon successful submission, the user is redirected to a thank-you page. The email sent via **EmailJS** contains the submitted form data, allowing for easy communication.

## Why I Did This Project
The purpose of this project was to test my understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** by creating a practical and interactive form. I wanted to implement what I've learned so far and experiment with integrating a third-party service (**EmailJS**) to handle the form submission.

I also aimed to challenge myself by applying new concepts, such as form validation, sending data to an email address via a third-party API, and using a multi-page structure to make the website more dynamic and functional.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the pages.
- **CSS** for styling the layout and form.
- **JavaScript** for handling form submissions and communicating with **EmailJS**.
- **EmailJS** for sending emails with the form data.

## Features
- **Multi-page layout**: A home page, contact form, and thank-you page.
- **Responsive form**: The contact form allows users to input their details and sends the data to an email upon successful submission.
- **EmailJS Integration**: The form sends an email to `richard.neal3@outlook.com` using the provided EmailJS API keys and template.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Navigate to the contact form, fill it out, and submit it to receive a confirmation email.

## Conclusion
This project helped me refine my skills in web development and gave me practical experience with form handling, third-party APIs, and multi-page web applications. It also provided an opportunity to explore new techniques and improve my coding abilities.
